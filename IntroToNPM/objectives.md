#What is NPM (Node Package Manager)?

* NPM is the package manager for Javascript
* What is a package? If we're writing node on the server side or use a library..
we cannot use a script tag because they do not exist. Instead, we use a NPM (package),
package = code that someone/group has written that we can include in our own 
projects. 
Libaries = Bootstrap & jQuery
* When people create web applications using Node, they don't do everything from scratch.
They use libaries, packs, frameworks to make things easier (Express, Mongoose)
There are close to 200k packages 

#Installing and Using Packages

* Use `npm install` to install a package
* Use `require()` to include a package
